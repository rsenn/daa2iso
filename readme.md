## About

Original author of this code is [Luigi Auriemma](http://aluigi.org), to whom all the credits for this code belong. See also [the original readme](https://github.com/undisk/daa2iso/blob/master/daa2iso.txt).

`daa2iso`'s latest version was published around 2009, and has since been made available in some popular GNU/Linux distributions' official repositories, such as:

* [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/daa2iso)
* [Fedora](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/package/rpms/daa2iso/)

Original source code of `daa2iso` is available on [Luigi's website](http://aluigi.altervista.org/mytoolz.htm#daa2iso), and now on GitHub, mainly for posterity, and accessorily for the purpose of the [undisk-app](https://https://github.com/undisk/undisk-app).

Publishing on GitHub simplifies processes like automatic download-and-build the sources. An example of that is [daa2iso-bin](https://github.com/undisk/daa2iso-bin), a modularized version of `daa2iso` (usable with Node.js), which can compile this code on-the-fly when installed.

You can grab the latest untouched version (0.1.7e) found on Luigi's website from [our `0.1.7e` release](https://github.com/undisk/cdi2iso/releases/tag/0.1.7e).
